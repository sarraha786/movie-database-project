# movie-database-project
top movies from IMDB, their ratings, their release date, each trailer from Youtube (for a list of 100 movies that does not entirely match up to the first table, but outputs useful information regarding movie trailers nonetheless), their view count, and dislike counts. We also used the TMDB database and used the IMDB list of movies to retrieve TMDB ratings for the same movies along with their popularity, release date, language, and vote count.
